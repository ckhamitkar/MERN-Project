In this MERN stack-based project we develop an e-learning course catalog website. We’ll display the list of all the courses on the website. The website will also allow users to search the available courses with a search bar. We’ll use the Express framework on Node.js to develop the back-end API, which will interact with the MongoDB database where the data is fetched from and stored. After setting up the backend, we’ll implement the front-end components and add search functionality. The finalized product will fetch the data from MongoDB via the NodeJS server and display it in the React functional components.

MERN is one of several variations of the MEAN stack
 (MongoDB Express Angular Node), 
 where the traditional Angular.js front-end framework is replaced with React.js. 
 Other variants include MEVN (MongoDB, Express, Vue, Node), 
 and really any front-end JavaScript framework can work
